        <h1>The Cobble Hill Jawas</h1>
    <p> We are the Cobble Hill Jawas, commonly known as the Jawas in our area (NOTICE - we have no affiliation with Star Wars. Please do not sue us.) We are a group of neighborhood kids that, using electronic junk found on the street/traded amongst each other/bought online or in person, build robots, small remote control flying machines, and electric skateboards, among other things. We take great pride in our creations, commonly setting up near our school playground. </p>
