         We are the Cobble Hill Jawas, commonly known as the Jawas in our area (NOTICE - we have no affiliation with Star Wars. Please do not sue us.). 
            We are a group of neighborhood kids that, using electronic junk found on the street/traded amongst each other/bought online or in person, build <b>robots, 
            small remote control flying machines, and electric skateboards,</b> among other things. We take great pride in our creations, commonly setting up near our school playground. <br>
